## Project Architecture
This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the bundler for fast development and optimized production builds.
- `app.tsx` defines the main application component containing your 3D content
- Modify the content inside the `<Canvas>` component to change what is visible on screen
- Static assets can be placed in the `public` folder
